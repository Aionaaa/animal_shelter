BRIEF:
Animal Shelter
The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

TECHNOLOGIES:
This project uses Ruby and SQL, with PostgreSQL, Sinatra, and Pry gems.
